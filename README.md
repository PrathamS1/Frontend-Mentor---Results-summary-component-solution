## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While doing this challenge I learned about the various properties of CSS styling and how exactly they affect the looks of the components. I did faced the challenge of making the solution responsive for mobile devices but I did my part and made it responsive, it is not as per the expected image though.
It is my first challenge and I hope to look for guidance in web development.

### Continued development

The grid property of css is what I lack understanding in. I realized that this challenge might have been easy using that property. There are many areas in which I need to develop my skills on, and I want to continue focusing of such by doing more challenges and finding the area of development.
